## Information Retrieval

### Text Processing


1. There's a function that reads in a text file and returns a list of the tokens in that file. A function that counts the number of occurrences of each word in the token list. And a method that prints out the word frequency counts ordered by decreasing frequency.

2. It takes two text files as arguments and outputs the number of
tokens they have in common.

3. It takes two word-frequency maps (given in two separate input text files) and creates an output word-frequency count file where the counts are added. The input and output files are of the form “word, count”, one of these per line.
